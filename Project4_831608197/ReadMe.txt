This project publishes the html files for all the packages inside this project.

The directory containing the HTML files is StoreHTMFiles which will be created in the current path.
There is an individual file called dependencyTable.htm which contains the hyperlinks between files showing their dependencies.
Each file also has a hyperlinks to dependent files on the top section which helps to navigate to other files likewise.
There are also javascript and css files present in the current path. The logic used for javascript is that
whenever we encounter an open brances we create a new button for expanding and collapsing the code under the braces. Each button is given
unique id based on static counter we increment for every new button.
The css stylesheet used is same as that given in the helper code for project3 starter.
 
Please refer the files : Addhtmlheader, javascript, css to see the configuration.
